# This is where our STATS 786 team works together.
I create the `STATS786 Group Project.Rmd` rmarkdown file. Use it to complete the job. 

Eric: ARIMA models
Jinze Li: ETS models, Exploratory data analysis
Yucheng Wang, Tongxin Li: Neural network autoregression models
(Corresponding model assumption checking should be carried)

Due time: 21/5/2024, before test set release.

Some kind suggestions: Instead of just submitting the final model, each change can be submitted to GitHub for other members to refer to or make suggestions.
Every time we finish writing code, submit it here and comment what you added/changed/deleted to let the group know what you did. 

Let's do thisüòÅ!
